    In this function, you will try to update the given user's bank account with the given amount.
    bank is a dictionary where the key is the username and the value is the user's account balance.
    log_in is a dictionary where the key is the username and the value is the user's log-in status.
    amount is the amount to update with, and can either be positive or negative.

    To update the user's account with the amount, the following requirements must be met:
    - The user exists in log_in and his/her status is True, meaning, the user is logged in.

    If the user doesn't exist in the bank, create the user.
    - The given amount can not result in a negative balance in the bank account.

    Return True if the user's account was updated.

    For example, if Brandon has 115.50 in his account:
    - Calling update(bank, log_in, "Brandon", 50) will return False, unless "Brandon" is first logged in.  Then it
    will return True.  Brandon will then have 165.50 in his account.
    - Calling update(bank, log_in, "Brandon", -200) will return False because Brandon does not have enough in his
    account.
