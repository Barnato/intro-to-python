def change_password(user_accounts, log_in, username, old_password, new_password):
    '''
    This function allows users to change their password.

    If all of the following requirements are met, changes the password and returns True. Otherwise, returns False.
    - The username exists in the user_accounts.
    - The user is logged in (the username is associated with the value True in the log_in dictionary)
    - The old_password is the user's current password.
    - The new_password should be different from the old one.
    - The new_password fulfills the requirement in signup.

    For example:
    - Calling change_password(user_accounts, log_in, "BrandonK", "123abcABC" ,"123abcABCD") will return False
    - Calling change_password(user_accounts, log_in, "Brandon", "123abcABCD", "123abcABCDE") will return False
    - Calling change_password(user_accounts, log_in, "Brandon", "brandon123ABC", "brandon123ABC") will return False
    - Calling change_password(user_accounts, log_in, "Brandon", "brandon123ABC", c"123abcABCD") will return True

    Hint: Think about defining and using a separate valid(password) function that checks the validity of a given password.
    This will also come in handy when writing the signup() function.
