def transfer(bank, log_in, userA, userB, amount):
    '''
    In this function, you will try to make a transfer between two user accounts.
    bank is a dictionary where the key is the username and the value is the user's account balance.
    log_in is a dictionary where the key is the username and the value is the user's log-in status.
    amount is the amount to be transferred between user accounts (userA and userB).  amount is always positive.

    What you will do:
    - Deduct the given amount from userA and add it to userB, which makes a transfer.
    - You should consider some following cases:
      - userA must be in the bank and his/her log-in status in log_in must be True.
      - userB must be in log_in, regardless of log-in status.  userB can be absent in the bank.
      - No user can have a negative amount in their account. He/she must have a positive or zero balance.

    Return True if a transfer is made.

    For example:
    - Calling transfer(bank, log_in, "BrandonK", "Jack", 100) will return False
    - Calling transfer(bank, log_in, "Brandon", "JackC", 100) will return False
    - After logging "Brandon" in, calling transfer(bank, log_in, "Brandon", "Jack", 10) will return True
    - Calling transfer(bank, log_in, "Brandon", "Jack", 200) will return False
